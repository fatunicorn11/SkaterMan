Hi Mr. Marchand,

Thank you for the amazing two years of teaching me Comp Sci. You're truly a great teacher
with an advanced understanding of computers. I know it is very unorthodox, but Phython is
my favorite language to work in and I wanted to challenge myself by trying to make something
using it. I hope this counts for the final as prior to your class I had 0 coding knowledge
but over the course of learning C and having an advanced understanding of programming as a
whole because of it, I feel like I can say I learned Python because of you and your class.
I had a great time over these last two years, and as I am a Computer Science major, the 
lessons that you taught me were invalueable. 

Thank you for being an amazing person and mentor.
